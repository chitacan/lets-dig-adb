# Let's Dig ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

GDG Korea Android Conf 2014 presentation.
Based on [Reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) & [Atom-Shell](https://github.com/atom/atom-shell)

## Development Prerequisites

* node.js
* bower
* grunt
* adb

## Run

Clone this repo and run following commands.

```
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

## activitykit demo

activitykit demo needs real android device or emulator. If you have neither, [genymotion](http://www.genymotion.com/) will be a neat solution.

## Trouble Shooting

* On Windows you need `MSVCR120.dll` to run Atom-Shell. If you don't have one, you can download it [here](http://www.microsoft.com/ko-KR/download/details.aspx?id=40784) (must be 32 bit version).
